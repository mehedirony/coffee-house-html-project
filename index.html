        <strong>Coffee</strong>  trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more than 30 feet (9
    meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow
    along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle, it’s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit
    simultaneously on a single tree. </p>
